# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
* Use AWS CloudFront
* Add Network ACL rule to block certain traffic

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
* This would only prevent access from the public internet, but does not assure unauthorized access from within the network.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Manually added changes will be overwritten, bringing back the initial vulnerabilities.
