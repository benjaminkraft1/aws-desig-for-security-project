Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
 The end users (Priviledged business user) should not be able to directly access the S3 Buckets. Instead the bucket should only be reachable from the Web Application, which should be the only interface to the customer.

# Poor practice 2
## Full access to all S3 Buckets from Application Server
```yaml
- PolicyName: InstanceRolePolicy-C3
    PolicyDocument:
    Version: 2012-10-17
    Statement:
        - Effect: Allow
        Action: 's3:*'
        Resource: '*'
```
### How to make it better
* Only List specific buckets that you need access to
* Allow Object Operations (e.g. Uploading, Downloading, Modifying ) only for objects in specific bucket
* Added S3 Deny on all other buckets for getObject Operations to protect data in other buckets
```yaml
- PolicyName: InstanceRolePolicy-C3
    PolicyDocument:
    Version: 2012-10-17
    Statement:
        - Effect: Allow
        Sid: 'ListObjectsInBucket'
        Action: 's3:ListBucket'
        Resource: 
        - arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-free-recipes-781430106937
        - arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-secret-recipes-781430106937
        - Effect: Allow
        Sid: 'AllObjectActions'
        Action: 's3:*Object'
        NotResource: 
        - arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-free-recipes-781430106937/*
        - arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-secret-recipes-781430106937/*
        - Effect: Deny
        Action: 's3:getObject'
        NotResource: 
        - arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-free-recipes-781430106937
        - arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-free-recipes-781430106937/*
